        <h2>About Matthew</h2>
        <p>After graduating from St. John's University, I decided I wanted to start a few businesses. I had so many ideas and executed them all at once. This led to <b>chaos</b>.</p>
        <p>After many ups and downs. I realized the business experience I've gained was worth its weight in <del>gold</del> bitcoin. I then decided my next step would be to learn how to code!</p>
        <p>If life were a puzzle, I'd say that learning to code is the last part I need to begin piecing it together. Coding helps my businesses run smoother, and more efficiently. I hope to become a hard-working member of a team, who are passionate about their interests and would also like to build something that makes lives better.</p>
